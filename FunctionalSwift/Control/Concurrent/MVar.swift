/// An `MVar` (pronounced "em-var") is a synchronising variable, used for communication between concurrent threads.
/// It can be thought of as a box, which may be empty or full.
///
/// An `MVar<A>` is mutable location that is either empty or contains a value of type `A`. It has two fundamental
/// operations: `put(_:)` which fills an `MVar` if it is empty and blocks otherwise, and `take()` which empties
/// an `MVar` if it is full and blocks otherwise. They can be used in multiple different ways:
/// 1. As synchronized mutable variables,
/// 2. As channels, with `take()` and `put(_:)` as receive and send, and
/// 3. As a binary semaphore `MVar<Void>`, with `take()` and `put(_:)` as wait and signal.
