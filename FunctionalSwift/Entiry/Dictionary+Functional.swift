// MARK: - Dictionary functor

/// An infix synonym for `map(_:)`.
///
/// The name of this operation is allusion to `^`. Note the similarities between their types:
///
///      (^)  : (T -> U)        T  ->     U
///     (<^>) : (T -> U) -> [V: T] -> [V: U]
///
/// __Examples__:
///
/// If you need transform all values of `Dictionary`:
///
///     let jsonToPrice: (JSON) -> Price = ...
///     let data: [Currency: JSON] = ...
///     // paymentMethods is [Currency: Price]
///     let paymentMethods = jsonToPrice <^> data
public func <^><T, U, Key>(_ transform: (T) -> U,
                           _ arg: [Key: T]) -> [Key: U] {
    var newDictionary: [Key: U] = [:]
    arg.forEach { pair in
        newDictionary[pair.0] = transform(pair.1)
    }
    return newDictionary
}

/// Replace all locations in the input with the same value.
/// The default definition is `map { _ in transform }`,
/// but this may be overridden with a more efficient version.
///
/// The name of this operation is allusion in `<^>`.
/// Note the similarities between their types:
///
///     (<^ )  : (     U) -> [V: T] -> [V: U]
///     (<^>)  : (T -> U) -> [V: T] -> [V: U]
///
/// Usually this operator is used for debugging.
///
/// - SeeAlso:
/// `<^>` operator.
public func <^<T, U, V>(_ transform: T, _ arg: [U: V]) -> [U: T] {
    return { _ in transform } <^> arg

/// Is flipped version of `<^`
///
/// - SeeAlso:
/// `<^>`, `<^` operators.
